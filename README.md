I developed an inventory app for the user to use to store their inventory data. I major to create a comprehensive UI. I made sure to have comprehensive you are because I wanted my customer to feel like the app actually helped them with their needs and to feel like the app was professionally made. When coding my app, I made sure to take precautions about doing things that I'm not sure it would work and I made sure that all of my processes were correct and were errorless. This code was actually a pretty good experience to see how the real world apps works and based on this experience I've started working on my own app.
